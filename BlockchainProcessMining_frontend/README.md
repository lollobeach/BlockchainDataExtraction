# Getting Started with the Data Extraction

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## How to run

In the same folder you have to clone two repositories:

**Backend**
```
git clone https://github.com/lollobeach/BlockchainProcessMining_backend.git
```

**Frontend**
```
git clone https://github.com/lollobeach/BlockchainProcessMining_frontend.git
```

Then, in both projects run:
```
npm install
```

And in `BlockchainProcessMining_frontend` run:
```
npm run start
```

This script will execute Express backend and React frontend together.
